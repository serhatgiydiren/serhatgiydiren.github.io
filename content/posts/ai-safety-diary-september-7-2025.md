Today, I explored a video from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) and a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below are the resources I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Prompt Engineering: A Deep Dive
- **Source**: [AI Prompt Engineering: A Deep Dive](https://youtu.be/T9aRN5JkmL8), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video examines advanced prompt engineering techniques to improve AI model performance and safety. It discusses how carefully crafted prompts can enhance alignment, reduce harmful outputs, and improve model reliability, critical for safe AI deployment.

## Resource: Faithfulness of LLM Self-Explanations for Commonsense Tasks
- **Source**: [Faithfulness of LLM Self-Explanations for Commonsense Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13445), arXiv:2503.13445, March 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper analyzes the faithfulness of LLM self-explanations for commonsense tasks, finding that larger models produce more faithful explanations. Instruction-tuning allows trade-offs but not Pareto dominance, impacting safety by complicating reliable monitoring of model reasoning.
