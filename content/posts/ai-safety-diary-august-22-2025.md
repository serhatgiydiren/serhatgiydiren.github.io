Today, I explored the audio version of a chapter from the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 2: Risks Audio)

- **Source**: [Chapter 2: Risks](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/02), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: The audio version of this chapter examines the risks associated with advanced AI systems, particularly as they approach or achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). It categorizes risks into several types, including misuse (e.g., malicious use by bad actors), accidents (e.g., unintended consequences from misaligned systems), and systemic risks (e.g., economic disruption or concentration of power). The chapter discusses the challenges of ensuring AI safety as systems scale, emphasizing the potential for catastrophic outcomes if risks are not mitigated. It also introduces key concepts like alignment failures, robustness issues, and the importance of proactive risk management to safeguard societal well-being.
