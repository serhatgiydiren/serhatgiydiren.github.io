Today, I began the [BlueDot AI Alignment course](https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment) and completed its first unit as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI and the Years Ahead

- **Source**: [Unit 1: AI and the Years Ahead](https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment/1), BlueDot Impact AI Alignment Course.
- **Summary**: This unit introduces the foundational concepts of AI and its potential future impacts. It describes AI as a collection of approaches, focusing on key techniques like neural networks, gradient descent, and transformers used to train large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. The unit explains how hardware advancements have driven AI progress and covers essential machine learning terms like weights, biases, parameters, neurons, and activations. It also explores the economic and non-economic incentives behind developing transformative AI systems and highlights recent advances in AI capabilities, providing a framework for understanding AIâ€™s societal and economic implications.[](https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment/1)
