Today, I explored a resource as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas - Chapter 7: Generalization
- **Source**: [AI Safety Atlas: Generalization](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/07)
- **Summary**: This chapter addresses the critical issue of generalization in AI systems. It explores the risk that an AI might perform well on its training data but fail to behave as intended when faced with novel, out-of-distribution situations in the real world. Ensuring robust generalization is crucial for developing reliable and safe AI.
