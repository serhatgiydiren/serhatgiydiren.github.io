Today, I explored a video from the AI Safety Atlas as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 3: Strategies)

- **Source**: The video corresponds to [Chapter 3: Strategies](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/03) of the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/). The specific video is available on YouTube: [Strategies | AI Safety Atlas](https://youtu.be/iO7Jl4xders?si=E4f5zwi8_Bg0JDuh).
- **Summary**: This video provides an overview of the main strategies the AI safety community is using to address potential risks. It breaks down the approaches into three pillars: technical research (solving alignment), policy and standards (shaping responsible development), and strategy (analyzing the big picture). This framework helps in understanding how different efforts in the field fit together to form a comprehensive plan for ensuring a beneficial future with AI.
