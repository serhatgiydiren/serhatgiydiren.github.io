Today, I explored a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: The Limits of Predicting Agents from Behaviour
- **Source**: [The Limits of Predicting Agents from Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02923), arXiv:2506.02923, June 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper examines the challenges of predicting AI agent behavior solely from observed actions, highlighting limitations in inferring intent or goals. It discusses implications for AI safety, emphasizing that incomplete behavioral models can lead to misjudgments about alignment or potential risks, necessitating robust monitoring and evaluation techniques.
