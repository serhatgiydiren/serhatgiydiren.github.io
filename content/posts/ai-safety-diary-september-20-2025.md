Today, I explored the audio version of a chapter from the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 8: Scalable Oversight Audio)

- **Source**: [Chapter 8: Scalable Oversight](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/08), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: The audio version of this chapter tackles the forward-looking problem of scalable oversight: creating methods to reliably supervise and correct AI systems that are smarter than humans. It explores research directions like debate, amplification, and recursive approval, which aim to break down complex tasks into verifiable steps, allowing human values to guide superintelligent systems effectively.
