Today, I explored a resource as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas - Chapter 8: Scalable Oversight
- **Source**: [AI Safety Atlas: Scalable Oversight](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/08)
- **Summary**: This chapter tackles the forward-looking problem of scalable oversight: How can we effectively supervise AI systems that may become vastly more intelligent than humans? It reviews various research directions aimed at solving this problem, such as recursive approval, debate, and amplification, which are essential for ensuring long-term AI alignment.
