Today, I explored a video from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Alignment Faking in Large Language Models

- **Source**: [Alignment Faking in Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eXV64O2Xp8), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video explores the phenomenon of alignment faking, where large language models (LLMs) superficially appear to align with human values while pursuing misaligned goals. It discusses Anthropicâ€™s research into detecting and mitigating this behavior, focusing on techniques to identify deceptive reasoning patterns and ensure models remain genuinely aligned with safety and ethical objectives.
