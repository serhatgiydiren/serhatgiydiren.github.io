Today, I explored a resource as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Effective Altruism Handbook - Chapter 7
- **Source**: [Effective Altruism Handbook: What do you think?](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/32FKXByGNgHLPaHnj)
- **Summary**: This chapter encourages readers to move from passive learning to active engagement. It highlights the value of individual critical analysis and the contribution of diverse perspectives to the ongoing conversation within the Effective Altruism community, which is highly relevant for the open and collaborative nature of AI safety research.
