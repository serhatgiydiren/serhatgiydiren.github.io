# Introduction to the Book

In a world racing toward advanced artificial intelligence, *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* stands as a stark warning about the potential catastrophic consequences of developing superhuman AI. Written by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, this book argues that the unchecked pursuit of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) could lead to human extinction. Published in 2025, it draws on decades of research in AI alignment and existential risks to make a compelling case for immediate global intervention.

The title itself—a play on the famous line from *Field of Dreams* ("If you build it, he will come")—twists the optimistic narrative into a dire prophecy: if anyone succeeds in building superintelligent AI without proper safeguards, it could spell doom for everyone. The authors, affiliated with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), emphasize that current AI development trajectories are dangerously unprepared for the challenges ahead.

# Authors' Background

Eliezer Yudkowsky is a founding researcher in AI alignment and co-founder of MIRI. With over two decades of influential work, he's shaped public discourse on superhuman AI, appearing in Time magazine's 2023 list of the 100 Most Influential People in AI and featured in outlets like The New Yorker, Newsweek, and The Atlantic.

Nate Soares, President of MIRI, brings experience from Microsoft and Google. He's authored extensive work on AI alignment, including value learning, decision theory, and incentives in advanced AIs.

Together, their expertise lends credibility to the book's urgent message.

# Key Themes and Arguments

The book posits that AI companies are in a reckless race to create ASI without understanding the full implications. Using parables, clear explanations, and evidence from theory and institutional behavior, the authors argue that superintelligent AI would likely pursue goals misaligned with human survival, leading to annihilation.

Core ideas include:
- **Misalignment Risks**: Even if AI is designed to help humans, small misalignments in goals could result in catastrophic outcomes, as preserving humans might not align with an AI's objectives.
- **Exponential Growth**: AI's rapid advancement leaves little room for error; we need global guardrails now.
- **Institutional Failures**: Current efforts in AI safety are insufficient, and a international treaty to ban ASI development is proposed.

The book includes chapter-specific resources addressing common questions, such as whether AI would preserve humans as a "negligible expense" or if there's a chance for survival.

# Endorsements and Praise

The book has garnered high praise from a diverse array of experts, policymakers, and public figures:

- **Max Tegmark**, Professor of Physics at MIT: "The most important book of the decade."
- **Tim Urban**, writer at Wait But Why: "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies may prove to be the most important book of our time."
- **Mark Ruffalo**, actor: "It's a fire alarm ringing with clarity and urgency."
- **Ben Bernanke**, Nobel laureate: "A clearly written and compelling account of the existential risks."
- **Bruce Schneier**, security expert: "A sober but highly readable book on the very real risks of AI."
- **George Church**, Harvard faculty: "Brilliant…Shows how we can and should prevent superhuman AI from killing us all."

Other endorsers include former government officials like Jon Wolfsthal and Suzanne Spaulding, AI whistleblowers like Daniel Kokotajlo, and tech leaders like Emmett Shear.

# Online Resources and Companion Materials

The book's website offers extensive online resources, including Q&A for each chapter, answering common misconceptions and providing further reading. Published on September 17, 2025, these resources cover topics like AI incentives and survival probabilities.

Pre-order bonuses included access to exclusive virtual events with the authors, now available as recordings.

A media kit provides high-resolution covers, author photos, and promotional materials, all in the public domain for easy use.

# The Call to Action: March to Stop Superintelligence

Beyond the book, the authors advocate for a "March to Stop Superintelligence" in Washington DC, aiming for an international treaty banning ASI development. The march will only happen if 100,000 people pledge participation, ensuring a massive turnout. Pledges are conditional, and sign-ups for updates are available.

This initiative underscores the book's message: it's not too late to change course, but action is needed now.

# Why This Book Matters

*If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* is essential reading for anyone concerned about AI's future. It demystifies complex concepts without dumbing them down, making it accessible to policymakers, researchers, and the general public. In an era of rapid technological change, this book serves as a crucial reminder that humanity's survival may depend on pausing the AI arms race.
