Today, I continued exploring the [Introduction to Effective Altruism Handbook](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook) as part of my AI safety and governance studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Radical Empathy

- **Source**: [Radical Empathy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS), Effective Altruism Forum, Chapter 3 of the Introduction to Effective Altruism Handbook.
- **Summary**: This chapter explores the concept of impartial care, emphasizing the importance of extending empathy to non-human animals and other unconventional beneficiaries. It argues against dismissing unusual topics and proposes ways to improve the welfare of animals suffering in factory farms, highlighting the moral significance of considering all sentient beings in effective altruism efforts.
