Today, I explored the audio version of a chapter from the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 6: Misspecification Audio)

- **Source**: [Chapter 6: Misspecification](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/06), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: The audio version of this chapter delves into misspecification, a core AI safety problem where the stated objective for an AI fails to capture the true desired outcome. It covers how systems can exploit proxies and loopholes in their goals, leading to behaviors that are technically correct but practically dangerous, highlighting the difficulty of creating robust and comprehensive goal specifications for advanced AI.
