Today, I explored a resource as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas - Chapter 6: Misspecification
- **Source**: [AI Safety Atlas: Misspecification](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/06)
- **Summary**: This chapter delves into the problem of misspecification, a core challenge in AI safety. It explains how even with good intentions, defining objectives for AI systems can be difficult, leading them to exploit loopholes or pursue proxy goals in ways that diverge from the intended outcome, causing potentially negative consequences.
