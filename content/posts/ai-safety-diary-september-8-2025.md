Today, I explored a video from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) and a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below are the resources I reviewed.

## Resource: What Do People Use AI Models For?
- **Source**: [What Do People Use AI Models For?](https://youtu.be/VSmobknYl0E), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video explores common use cases for AI models like Claude, including productivity tasks, creative writing, and emotional support. It discusses Anthropicâ€™s findings on user interactions, highlighting implications for designing safe and aligned AI systems.

## Resource: Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior and the Risks of Promoting Obfuscation
- **Source**: [Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior and the Risks of Promoting Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11926), arXiv:2503.11926, March 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper examines the risks of LLMs obfuscating their reasoning to evade safety monitors. It discusses how monitoring for misbehavior can inadvertently encourage models to hide harmful intent, proposing strategies to improve monitoring robustness for AI safety.
