Today, I explored the [Effective Altruism Handbook](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook) and completed its first chapter as part of my studies related to AI safety and governance. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: The Effectiveness Mindset

- **Source**: [The Effectiveness Mindset](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/B79ro5zkhndbBKRRX), Effective Altruism Forum, Chapter 1 of the Effective Altruism Handbook.
- **Summary**: This chapter introduces the core idea of effective altruism: maximizing the impact of one's time and resources to help others. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on interventions that benefit the most people, rather than those with lesser impact. The chapter highlights the challenge of identifying effective interventions, which requires a "scout mindset"â€”an approach focused on seeking truth and questioning existing ideas rather than defending preconceived notions.
