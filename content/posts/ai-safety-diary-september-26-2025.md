Today, I explored a lecture from the AI Safety Book series as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Book (Chapter 2: AI Fundamentals)

- **Source**: This lecture is the second chapter of the [AI Safety Book](https://www.aisafetybook.com/), presented in video format. The specific video is [Lecture 2 | AI Fundamentals](https://youtu.be/tWV3wdY2870?si=uUy7kUXFgibHuwBN).
- **Summary**: This lecture provides a crash course in the technical concepts that underpin modern AI. It covers the basics of machine learning, the structure of neural networks, and the principles of deep learning and reinforcement learning. This foundational knowledge is essential for understanding the specific challenges that arise in AI safety, as the nature of these systems is what gives rise to alignment problems.
