Today, I explored the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 1: Capabilities)

- **Source**: [Chapter 1: Capabilities - Video Lecture (AI is Advancing Faster Than You Think! (AI Safety symposium 2/5))](https://youtu.be/J_iMeH1hb9M?si=Ds7buMC7off_dD8A), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: This chapter provides an overview of AI capabilities, focusing on the progression of modern AI systems toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). It discusses the increasing power of foundation models, such as large language models, and the importance of defining and measuring intelligence for safety purposes. The chapter explores challenges in defining intelligence, comparing approaches like the Turing Test, consciousness-based definitions, process-based adaptability, and a capabilities-focused framework. It emphasizes the latter, which assesses what AI systems can do, their performance levels, and the range of tasks they can handle, as the most practical for safety evaluations. The chapter also introduces frameworks for measuring AI progress on a continuous spectrum, moving beyond binary distinctions like narrow versus general AI, to better understand capabilities and associated risks.[](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/01/03)
