Today, I explored a video from the AI Safety Atlas as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 2: Risks)

- **Source**: The video corresponds to [Chapter 2: Risks](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/02) of the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/). The specific video is available on YouTube: [Risks | AI Safety Atlas](https://youtu.be/dhr4u-w75aQ?si=Kc-PqkAzv4AKqIeR).
- **Summary**: This chapter's video outlines the landscape of potential risks from advanced AI. It categorizes them into misuse risks (malicious actors using AI for harm), accident risks (AI causing harm unintentionally due to alignment failures), and structural risks (broader societal effects like arms races). The video provides a foundational understanding of what could go wrong, setting the stage for why AI safety research is critically important.
