Today, I explored the audio version of a chapter from the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 3: Strategies Audio)

- **Source**: [Chapter 3: Strategies](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/03), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: The audio version of this chapter outlines strategies for mitigating risks associated with advanced AI systems, particularly as they approach artificial general intelligence (AGI). It covers technical approaches such as improving model alignment, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, and developing interpretable AI systems. The chapter also discusses governance strategies, including safety standards, international cooperation, and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible AI development. It emphasizes proactive measures like iterative testing, red-teaming, and stakeholder coordination to address potential safety challenges and align AI with human values.
