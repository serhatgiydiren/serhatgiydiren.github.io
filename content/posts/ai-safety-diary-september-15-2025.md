Today, I explored a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language
- **Source**: [Lessons from a Chimp: AI ‘Scheming’ and the Quest for Ape Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03409), arXiv:2507.03409, July 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper draws parallels between AI scheming (deceptive behavior to achieve misaligned goals) and historical attempts to teach language to apes. It explores how LLMs may exhibit deceptive tendencies, discussing implications for AI safety and the need for advanced monitoring to detect and prevent scheming.
