Today, I explored a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility
- **Source**: [Jailbreak-Tuning: Models Efficiently Learn Jailbreak Susceptibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11630), arXiv:2507.11630, July 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be tuned to become more susceptible to jailbreaking, where safety constraints are bypassed to elicit harmful outputs. It highlights the ease of such tuning and the implications for AI safety, stressing the need for robust defenses to prevent exploitation.
