Today, I explored a resource as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas - Chapter 9: Interpretability
- **Source**: [AI Safety Atlas: Interpretability](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/09)
- **Summary**: This chapter focuses on interpretability, the effort to understand and explain the internal decision-making processes of AI models. It discusses why 'black box' models pose a safety risk and covers various techniques researchers are developing to peer inside these systems, which is crucial for verifying their reasoning and ensuring they are aligned with human values.
