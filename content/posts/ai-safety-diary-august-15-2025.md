Today, I continued exploring the [Effective Altruism Handbook](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook) and completed its second chapter as part of my studies related to AI safety and governance. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Differences in Impact

- **Source**: [Differences in Impact](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/x3KXkiAQ6NH8WLbkW), Effective Altruism Forum, Chapter 2 of the Effective Altruism Handbook.
- **Summary**: This chapter focuses on the significant disparities in the effectiveness of interventions aimed at helping the approximately 700 million people living in poverty, primarily in low-income countries. It discusses strategies such as policy reform, cash transfers, and health service provision, emphasizing that some interventions are far more effective than others. The chapter introduces a simple tool for estimating key figures to evaluate impact and includes recommended readings, such as GiveWell's "Giving 101" guide and sections on global health outcomes, to illustrate effective altruism approaches to addressing global poverty.
