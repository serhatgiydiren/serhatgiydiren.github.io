Today, I explored a video from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: Defending Against AI Jailbreaks

- **Source**: [Defending Against AI Jailbreaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaNXYqcfDyo), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video examines Anthropicâ€™s strategies for defending against AI jailbreaks, where users attempt to bypass model safety constraints to elicit harmful or unintended responses. It discusses techniques like robust prompt engineering, adversarial testing, and model fine-tuning to enhance resilience against such exploits, emphasizing their critical role in maintaining AI safety.
