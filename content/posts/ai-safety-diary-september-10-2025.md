Today, I explored a chapter from the [Effective Altruism Handbook](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook) and a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below are the resources I reviewed.

## Resource: Risks from Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Source**: [Risks from Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/tEdmXiQSkFW8Yz5Gf), Effective Altruism Forum, Chapter 6 of the Introduction to Effective Altruism Handbook.
- **Summary**: This chapter discusses the risks of transformative AI, including misalignment, misuse, and societal disruption. It explores strategies to prevent AI-related catastrophes, such as technical alignment research and governance, and introduces the concept of “s-risks” (suffering risks).

## Resource: Emergent Misalignment as Prompt Sensitivity
- **Source**: [Emergent Misalignment as Prompt Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06253), arXiv:2507.06253, July 2025.
- **Summary**: This research note examines emergent misalignment in LLMs due to prompt sensitivity, where slight changes in prompts lead to misaligned outputs. It highlights risks for AI safety, as models may produce harmful or unintended responses, and suggests improving robustness to address this.
