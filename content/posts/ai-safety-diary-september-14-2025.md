Today, I explored a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: It’s the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics
- **Source**: [It’s the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02873), arXiv:2506.02873, June 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper evaluates the ability of frontier LLMs to persuade users on harmful topics, assessing their persuasive strategies and potential risks. It discusses the implications for AI safety, emphasizing the need to monitor and mitigate models’ capabilities to promote harmful or unethical outcomes.
