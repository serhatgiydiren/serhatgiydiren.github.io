Today, I explored a lecture from the AI Safety Book series as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Book (Chapter 4: Safety Engineering)

- **Source**: This lecture is the fourth chapter of the [AI Safety Book](https://www.aisafetybook.com/), presented in video format. The specific video is [Lecture 4 | Safety Engineering](https://youtu.be/R7sazz_MtP8?si=lRJ-tcATof1Yq2c4).
- **Summary**: This lecture frames AI safety as a rigorous engineering discipline. It explores how principles from established fields like aviation and nuclear safety can be adapted to AI. Topics include robustness, assurance, and creating systems that are resilient to failure and predictable in their behavior. The goal is to move from theoretical alignment concepts to building real-world systems that we can trust to be safe.
