Today, I explored the audio version of a chapter from the [AI Safety Atlas](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/) as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Safety Atlas (Chapter 4: Governance Audio)

- **Source**: [Chapter 4: Governance](https://ai-safety-atlas.com/chapters/04), AI Safety Atlas by Markov Grey and Charbel-RaphaÃ«l Segerie et al., French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), 2025.
- **Summary**: The audio version of this chapter focuses on governance strategies for ensuring the safe development and deployment of advanced AI systems. It explores frameworks such as safety standards, international treaties, and regulatory policies to manage AI risks. The chapter discusses the trade-offs between centralized and decentralized approaches to AI access, the role of stakeholder collaboration, and the importance of establishing robust oversight mechanisms to align AI systems with societal values and prevent misuse or unintended consequences.
