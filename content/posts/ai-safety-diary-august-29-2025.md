Today, I explored a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below is the resource I reviewed.

## Resource: AI Governance to Avoid Extinction: The Strategic Landscape and Actionable Research Questions

- **Source**: [AI Governance to Avoid Extinction: The Strategic Landscape and Actionable Research Questions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04592) by Peter Barnett and Aaron Scher, arXiv:2505.04592, May 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper outlines the catastrophic risks of advanced AI, including human extinction from misalignment, misuse, or geopolitical conflict. It proposes four scenarios for AI development, favoring an "Off Switch" and international halt on dangerous AI activities. The authors highlight the need for urgent research into governance mechanisms, such as technical infrastructure for restricting AI development and international agreements to mitigate risks.[](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2309.15402)
