Today, I explored a video from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) and two research papers as part of my AI safety studies. Below are the resources I reviewed.

## Resource: What Should an AI’s Personality Be?
- **Source**: [What Should an AI’s Personality Be?](https://youtu.be/iyJj9RxSsBY), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video discusses the design of AI personalities, exploring how traits like helpfulness and honesty can be shaped to align with human values. It addresses the challenges of ensuring consistent, safe, and ethical behavior in LLMs, critical for AI alignment.

## Resource: Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs
- **Source**: [Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640), arXiv:2502.08640, February 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper explores emergent value systems in AI, proposing utility engineering to analyze and control these systems. It discusses methods to align AI objectives with human values, reducing risks of misalignment and ensuring safer AI behavior.

## Resource: Evaluating the Goal-Directedness of Large Language Models
- **Source**: [Evaluating the Goal-Directedness of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11844), arXiv:2504.11844, April 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes methods to evaluate the goal-directedness of LLMs, assessing whether models pursue coherent objectives that could lead to unintended consequences. It highlights implications for AI safety, emphasizing the need to monitor and control goal-driven behavior.
