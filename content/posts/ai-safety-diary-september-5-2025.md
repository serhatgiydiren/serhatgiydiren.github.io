Today, I explored resources from the [Anthropic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@anthropic-ai) and a research paper as part of my AI safety studies. Below are the resources I reviewed.

## Resource: Scaling Interpretability
- **Source**: [Scaling Interpretability](https://youtu.be/sQar5NNGbw4), Anthropic YouTube channel.
- **Summary**: This video discusses challenges and approaches to scaling interpretability for increasingly complex AI models. It covers Anthropicâ€™s efforts to develop scalable methods, like automated feature analysis, to understand LLMs, emphasizing their importance for ensuring safety as models grow in capability.

## Resource: Walk the Talk? Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations
- **Source**: [Walk the Talk? Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14150), arXiv:2504.14150, April 2025.
- **Summary**: This paper examines the faithfulness of explanations provided by LLMs, particularly in chain-of-thought reasoning. It proposes metrics to evaluate whether explanations accurately reflect model reasoning, revealing gaps that impact AI safety and the reliability of monitoring techniques.
